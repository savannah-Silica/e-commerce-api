# E-Commerce Backend with Django REST Framework

Welcome to the open-source e-commerce backend project powered by Django REST Framework. This project aims to provide a robust and flexible API for building e-commerce applications. Contributors like you play a crucial role in enhancing this project's features and making it even better.



## Getting Started

Before diving into the project, make sure you're familiar with Django and Django REST Framework. If not, you can refer to their official documentation:


- [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/)
- [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)

#### Also checkout the project's ER-Diagram

#### To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Fork this repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this GitHub page to create a copy in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone your fork**: Clone the repository to your local development environment using `git clone`.

3. **Install dependencies**: Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. **Apply migrations**: Run Django migrations to create the database schema: `python manage.py migrate`.

5. **Create a superuser**: Create a superuser account to access the Django admin panel: `python manage.py createsuperuser`.

8. **Run the development server**: Start the Django development server with `python manage.py runserver`.

Now you should be able to access the project at `http://localhost:8000/` and the Django admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin/`.

## Project Overview

This e-commerce backend project provides a powerful API for building e-commerce websites and applications. Here's an overview of its main features:

## Features to be implemented

7. **Merge**: Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the `main` branch.
   
## Development Process

To maintain a clean and modular codebase, we follow a structured development process. Each feature should be implemented in its own app, ensuring a clear separation of concerns. Additionally, the API side of each feature is developed in a dedicated folder within the `api` app. Let's walk through the process using the example of the shopping cart feature:

1. **Create a New Feature Branch:**
   Before starting, create a new branch for the feature.
     ```
     git checkout -b feature-shopping-cart
     ```
2. **Implement Feature in Feature App:**
   Create a new app for the shopping cart feature.
     ```
     python manage.py startapp shopping_cart
     ```
   Implement the feature within the `shopping_cart` app.
   Write comprehensive tests for the feature to ensure robust functionality.
3. **Create a PR for the Feature Branch:**
   Once the feature is complete and tested, create a pull request for the feature branch.
4. **Create API Folder in `api` App:**
   Inside the `api` app, create a dedicated folder for the shopping cart API.
     ```
     cd api
     mkdir shopping_cart     ```
5. **Implement Feature Code in the API Folder:**
   Implement the relevant code for the `shopping_cart` app in the corresponding `api/shopping_cart` folder.
6. **Test API Endpoints:**
   Ensure that the API endpoints related to the shopping cart feature are working correctly.
     ```
     python manage.py test api.shopping_cart
     ```
This process ensures a clean separation between the feature implementation and its corresponding API, promoting modularity and maintainability. Remember to write comprehensive tests for both the feature and its API to ensure the reliability of your code. Repeat these steps for each new feature, creating a dedicated app for the feature and organizing its API code within the `api` app.
